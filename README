MyNote Version 0.0.8-4
============
This is a application for:
1. search local html files
2. create and search local text notes
3. create and search local rich notes(html notes)
4. encrypt and decrypt local text and rich notes files(include database)

Installation
============
Before you run it, please install the following packages.
Some packages in the "MyNote/vendor".
To install:
1. python-setuptools
2. python-lxml
3. tornado >= 3.1.1
4. toro >= 0.8
5. jieba
6. python-dateutil
7. pyyaml
8. whoosh
9. python-bs4
10. numpy
11. cython
12. tea (a python and cython module for encrypt and decrypt)
13. chardet

In Windows, you can install mingw, cython and numpy, then can install tea(use C extension),
or, if you don't want to install mingw, cython and numpy, you can install tea(use pure python),
tea packages will detect if cython has been installed and then install tea with it or not.
Without cython and numpy, encrypt and decrypt speed will slow down.

In Linux, you just install cython and numpy, then install tea.

You can install nginx with upload-module, or just use tornado itself.

Configuration
=============
1. there is a folder at "MyNote/data", it is a template for MyNote's data folder,
   copy it to a directory where you want to store MyNote's data, and you can rename
   the folder.
2. change the configuration.yml at "MyNote/app/configuration.yml", the "DATA_PATH"
   is the folder you copy at the previous step.
3. configure other options at the configuration.yml file.
4. run the MyNote.py at "MyNote/app/MyNote.py", 
   at linux: 
   $ cd /path to MyNote/app
   run it at background
   $ nohup python ./MyNote.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   or run it at foreground
   $ python ./MyNote.py
 
   at windows:
   > cd \path to MyNote\app
   > python MyNote.py
   or

5. open you Web browser(firefox or chrome), and type your local url(SERVER_SCHEME://SERVER_HOST:SERVER_PORT) 
   to your note page, "SERVER_SCHEME", "SERVER_HOST", "SERVER_PORT" is what you configure
